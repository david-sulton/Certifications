# Overall explanation
OBJ-5.2: The Windows command line does support some fundamental scripting, as shown in this answer. Use an iterative variable to set the starting value (start#) and then step through a set range of values until the value exceeds the set ending value (end#). /L will execute the iterative by comparing start# with end#. If start# is less than end#, the command will execute. When the iterative variable exceeds end#, the command shell exits the loop. You can also use a negative step# to step through a range in decreasing values. For example, (1,1,5) generates the sequence 1 2 3 4 5 and (5,-1,1) generates the sequence (5 4 3 2 1). The syntax is: "for /L %variable in (start# step# end#) do command [CommandLineOptions]."
