## OSI model
Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away!!!

- 1. Physical Layer (Layer 1): This layer deals with the physical and electrical representation of the network. It handles the transmission of raw bit streams over a physical medium like cables or wireless signals. Think of it as the hardware layer, defining things like voltage levels, cable types, and data transmission rates. 
- 2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2): This layer is responsible for reliable data transfer between two directly connected nodes on the same network segment. It packages bits into frames, handles error detection and correction, and manages access to the physical medium (e.g., using MAC addresses). 
- 3. Network Layer (Layer 3): This layer deals with routing data packets across networks. It selects the best path for data to travel from source to destination, using logical addressing like IP addresses. Routers operate at this layer. 
- 4. Transport Layer (Layer 4): This layer ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data between applications. It handles segmentation, flow control, and error control. It also manages connection establishment and termination. 
- 5. Session Layer (Layer 5): This layer manages communication sessions between applications. It establishes, coordinates, and terminates connections (sessions) between applications, ensuring smooth communication flow. 
- 6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6): This layer handles data representation and formatting. It translates, encrypts, and compresses data to ensure the receiving application can understand it. 
- 7. Application Layer (Layer 7): This is the layer closest to the user, providing the interface for applications to access network services. Examples include web browsers, email clients, and file transfer applications
